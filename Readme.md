# <span style="color:blue">HTTP Server from Scratch in Go

## <span style="color:blue">Overview
This project is an implementation of a simple **HTTP server** built **from scratch** on top of **TCP sockets** in Go.  
Instead of relying on Go's standard `net/http` package, the server directly uses low-level TCP connections to parse HTTP requests and send responses manually.  

This helps in understanding:
- How **TCP** provides the reliable transport layer.
- How **HTTP** is built on top of TCP.
- How web servers process client requests and send structured responses.

## <span style="color:blue">What is TCP?
- **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)** is a core protocol of the Internet protocol suite.
- It provides a **reliable, ordered, and error-checked** stream of communication between applications.
- Key features:
  - Connection-oriented (requires handshake before communication).
  - Guarantees delivery of packets in order.
  - Used by many application protocols (e.g., HTTP, FTP, SMTP).

## <span style="color:blue">What is HTTP?
- **Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)** is an **application layer protocol** that runs on top of TCP.
- It defines rules for communication between **clients (browsers)** and **servers** on the web.
- HTTP messages consist of:
  - A **request line** (e.g., `GET /index.html HTTP/1.1`).
  - **Headers** (metadata like `Host`, `Content-Type`, etc.).
  - An optional **body** (used in `POST` requests).
- Servers reply with:
  - A **status line** (e.g., `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`).
  - **Headers**.
  - A **response body** (HTML, JSON, files, etc.).

---

## <span style="color:blue">Project Goal
- Implement a **basic HTTP server** in Go using raw TCP sockets.
- Handle incoming connections, parse raw HTTP requests, and return HTTP responses.
- Gain deeper insight into how higher-level protocols (HTTP) are built over lower-level protocols (TCP).

## <span style="color:blue">Tech Stack
- **Language**: Go (Golang)  
- **Protocols**: TCP (transport layer), HTTP (application layer)

---

## <span style="color:blue">Future Enhancements
- Support for multiple routes.
- Handling different HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, etc.).
- Parsing and responding with JSON.
- Basic concurrency for handling multiple clients.
